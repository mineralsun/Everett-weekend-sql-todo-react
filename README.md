# Project Name

Everett's Exceptional TO-DO APP!

## Description

Duration: 2 Weeks

In my TO-DO app, my goal was to create function web application that a user could add Tasks, task descriptions, and mark whether or not those tasks had been completed. Finally they would be able to delete those tasks from the database upon completion. 

App currently should be deployed locally to test!

### Prerequisites

NODE.js
Express
React
Axios

## Installation

1. Create a database called 'weekend-to-do-app'
2. Copy the queries and execute them in order on the database.sql file included in the project
3. Open up your editor of choice and run `npm install`
4. Make sure to set PORT number to desired localhost port in the server.js file and in the package.json proxy portion
5. In a terminal, run `npm run server`
6. Open another terminal window and run `npm run client`
7. The "npm run client" will open a browser window with the application open!

## Usage

1. Type a task name into the taskName entry box
2. Type a description into the taskDesc entry box
3. Hit enter on your keyboard or the submit button
4. The task should appened to the DOM
5. If you have finished the task, hit the "complete" button to cross it off your list!
6. If you wish to delete the task, simply click the delete button! 
7. Repeat to your heart's desire!!
